Simple image gallery

I will try to add functionality later, like 
  - uploading own photos
  - changing views (i.e. making folders/categories)
  - creating collage by choosing pics and arranging them in 1 frame.
  
Some issues so far:
  - I tried to put image for background, but it looks bat if it repeats and it ends if I add more content.
  - The footer moves when you scroll up and down, it stays in front of the content, not below.
